       No, it’s not located in Japan, not even in the biggest Japanesetown of the world. It’s in a very cool area of London, and it will impress you!

       First of all, long story short: I used to hate sushi. My first experience with sushi was in a restaurant called “Sushi Club” in Plaza de Santo Domingo in Madrid. Place that I don’t recommend you at all. After eating there, I swore to myself that I would never eat sushi again. But then a hot guy came to my life, and he loves it, and he invited me, so the second time that I went to a Japanese restaurant was some years later. It was in “San Q” restaurant in Santa Fe, NM. I didn’t want to eat any sushi , so I started with Teriyaki and stuff. Then I went to Sao Paulo, I ate some more sushi, and then this what I am telling you.

       So let’s start to talk about this restaurant, called “Hi Sushi Salsa!”, by the way, that could make me go from the hate to the love for sushi.
